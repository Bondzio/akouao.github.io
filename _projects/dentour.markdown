##### <strong> Motivation </strong>

The motivation behind the team-built Dentour Virtual Reality (VR) application was to create a safe immersive experience of virtual reality that enables phobia sufferers between the ages of 12-16 to accommodate themselves to frightening stimuli in preparation for similar experiences within a dental surgery.

##### <strong> Technology Stack </strong>
- ReactJS
- ReactVR

As this tour has been designed for teenagers between the ages of 12-16, special features and considerations have been implemented/taken to enhance their experience including interactive quizzes to encourage exploration and excitement for the business visit, bright and eye-catching colour schemes and assisted speech.

##### <strong> Assisted Speech </strong>

Increasing accessibility is such an important part of this project. Decreasing a child's fear is the main aim, any child/user should be able to reap the benefits of this tour. This is why I implemented assisted speech into the tour for patients who would benefit from auditory assistance.

All prevention guidelines and user information messages have been recorded for users to listen to as well as read. As the project progresses more of the icons, room names and help instructions will be accessibly for visually impaired users.
