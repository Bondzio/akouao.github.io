<strong>September 2019 - Present :</strong> Graduate Solution Architect - <em>Red Hat</em>

Since starting at Red Hat, I contributed to and have helped deliver a range of workshops for customers, partners and associates on several topics, including OpenShift and Kubernetes, Enterprise vs Kubernetes, and agile methodologies.

I have demonstrated my strong communication and personal skills in my experience of being a Partner Account Manager. I assisted and engaged the respective partner to further strengthen their relationship with Red Hat and align with Red Hat's strategy.

I have co-facilitated a panel session of over 150 attendees, and will shortly be presenting on the UK General Insurance industry to an audience of x for a region-wide company event; this has allowed me to exhibit and enhance my virtual presence.

The graduate programme is focused on training and development. To further my technical knowledge, I gained a certification in Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator (RHCSA). Soft skills development includes presentation delivery, sales techniques and whiteboarding. I have demonstrated my aptitude for product management through my thorough and intricate implementation of Graduate Starter Packs, designed to close the knowledge gap and accelerate new hires who are working from home.

Outside of my role I sought to further engage black associates, and founded a regional Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) community called Blacks United in Leadership and Diversity (B.U.I.L.D.) UK & Ireland. The mission of the community is to identify, empower and further the diversity in talent of black associates in the UK & Ireland.
